# Puzzle Fighter

This is a generic implementation of a
[Code Wars](https://codewars.com)
Kata called
[Puzzle Fighter](https://www.codewars.com/kata/puzzle-fighter/ruby)
in Ruby. In short it is a reimplementation of an engine from games like
[Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Puzzle_Fighter_II_Turbo).
One of the modern examples of such games is
[Crystal Crysis](https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/crystal-crisis).
Whole implementation is contained in one file `app.rb` due to the fact Code
Wars requires inline solution.

While solving this Kata I was trying to avoid mutation as much possible. Every
time new state change was introduced new representation of whole state of
game board was created and returned with the change applied. This resulted in
possibility to create command pipelines, like:

```ruby
def call
  @blocks
    .then(&Rainbow)
    .then(&PowerCombiner)
    .then(&method(:crash_logic))
    .then(&PowerCombiner)
    .then(&PowerExpander)
    .then(&PowerMerger)
end
```

End result is quite slow. The pin-point of this solution is a calculation
of largest rectangle-shaped subarea of the matrix. This is required to form
Power Gems. It uses generic O(nÂ²) alghoritm which is using whole board every
time. There are better solutions, including some hacky optimisations which are
possible in case of small, 6x12 matrix. Desipte this, with some trivial, ad-hoc
caching tricks this solution managed to pass Code Wars test suite with limit of
12s in just about 8s seconds.

I encourage everyone to try to create own implementation. This task includes
many intreresting caveats. It encourages patters, which are rarely used, if
most of what you do on daily basis is Web development.
